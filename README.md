> A Minecraft 1.14 data pack that prevents the dragon from destroying more end-based blocks

This data pack prevents all end stone variants (stairs, slabs etc.), purpur stone variants, the dragon egg and the dragon head as well as the chorus fruit and plant blocks from being destroyed by the Ender Dragon.

## FAQ

__Q: How do I add more blocks to this list?__

__A:__ You just need to add more block IDs to [this file](data/minecraft/tags/blocks/dragon_immune.json). Every block listed in here will not get destroyed by the dragon.

## License

The data pack is licensed under the GPLv3. For more information, take a look at the license file within this repository. If you want to modify the data pack for various reasons (building a city in the end but still spawning the dragon), I would suggest to clone/download this repo, make your changes and install them to your server :)
